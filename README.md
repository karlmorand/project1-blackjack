GA WDI-Remote project 1. Blackjack game.

**Basic Structure** - Two (human) player blackjack game. A player wins by having their total of cards reach 21 or be closer to 21 than their opponent. If they go over 21 then they lose.

**Solo gameplay** - The player and dealer recieve two cards, only one of the dealer's cards is visible to the player. The player then decides to stay or take more cards to try to reach 21. If the player goes over 21 they bust, and the game is over. Once the player decides to stay the dealer will play, following the established rules for when a dealer will hit or stay. At the end of the dealer's turn the winner of the game is decided.

**Gameplay for 2** - Both players are dealt two cards 'face-down' (meaning player two shouldn't be looking at the screen). P1 has the option to get an additional card or hold at what he has. P1 can take as many cards as he wants to try to get close to 21. Once he decides to stop taking cards his turn is over and player 2 can decide to take additional cards or hold. Once player two decides to hold, and assuming neither player has busted, it is the dealer's turn. Once the dealer has played, based on the dealer's rules, the game will end and a winner will be decided.

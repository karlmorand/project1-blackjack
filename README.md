# Project #1 - Blackjack

## Description
A blackjack game where the user can play against the AI dealer. Betting is built into the game as a way to track wins and losses across multiple games.

## Game Rules  
The dealer deals two cards to himself and the player, starting with the player. Only one of the dealer's cards is visible to the player. If the player's cards total 21 on the initial deal the player wins.  

The player then has the option to receive an additional card ('Hit') or end their turn. They can take as many additional cards as they'd like, with the goal being to have the sum of their cards equal 21. If the player goes over 21 he busts and the dealer wins.  

The player starts with $500 to bet with, and can make a bet before each game. All ties go to the player. Aces can be used as a 1 or 11.

## Technologies
Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3.

## Unsolved Issues
I'd like to grow the multiplayer aspect of the game so that a user could play at a table with multiple AI players. The visual design of the game could also be improved. I would also add some timers throughout the game so certain gameplay events happen less instantaneously, which would feel more realistic.

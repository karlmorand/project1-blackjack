GA WDI-Remote project 1. Blackjack game.

**Basic Structure** - Two (human) player blackjack game. A player wins by having their total of cards reach 21 or be closer to 21 than their opponent. If they go over 21 then they lose.

**Gameplay** - Both players are dealt two cards 'face-down' (meaning player two shouldn't be looking at the screen). P1 has the option to get an additional card or hold at what he has. P1 can take as many cards as he wants to try to get close to 21. Once he decides to stop taking cards his turn is over and player 2 can decide to take additional cards or hold.

**Goals**
  - Play against an AI dealer and other AI 'people'  
  - Ability for player to split hand if they are dealt a pair  
  - Betting as a more interesting way to keep score over multiple games  
  - Local storage to track results across sessions  
  - Skeuomorphic gaming table and sounds
